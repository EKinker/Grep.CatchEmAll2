PART 2:
a) How many pokemon are there? Show your grep that you used to get to that number.
15    ggrep -c 'txt$' captured/* | wc -l

Removed the instructions because it would throw off the count.  I could have set it to ignore the instructions... but we don't need that file



b) Who are the three biggest pokemon? (number of lines) Show the grep that you used to get to the result.
Beedrill, Charizard, Pikachu
ggrep -c '.' captured/* | sort -t ':' -k2 -nr | head -n 3

Search for a count of everything in the captured directory, then sort:
-t ':'  field delimiter using : to separate
-k2     sort look in the 2nd field (separated by :)
-nr     and return numbers in reverse

then take the top 3 (head -n 3)
